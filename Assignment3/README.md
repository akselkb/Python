## Adversarial search: MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

Assignment from TDT4136 - Introduction to Artifical Intelligence. 
The task were to implement the MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms in order to create an agent for the Pac-Man game.
In Multiagents.py you can find my implementation of these algorithms.

The autograder.py file tests and grades the algorithms in the Multiagents.py file given different maps and depths. My implementation got the best results possible, i.e. 5/5 for both the MiniMax algorithm and  the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.
